Assignment 1:
-Prompt open to ask what the lunar animal year:
-Edit the value case then compare
* Rooster : yes
* Chicken: yes
* Different than above: no, try again
* Submit plan: make them play

Assignment 2:
-Prompt open to ask the user to enter the value and find out the TYPEs
-The user is too lazy to enter any value, 'can't double of empty value' message shown, everything should happen as following:
  -If the value is NaN:
    * number: duplicate it
    * number along with funny signs ($#^/&): it may or may not be an Object, could be a date object such as 2/2/2017!
  -Else the value is NaN:
    * carry {} or []: must be an Object
    * true or false: boolean
    * string: almost everything Else
    * falling in default message if above isn't met

Assignment 3:
    * Explain mostly in the scope.js file



----NEED TO IMPROVE:----
* SHOULD NOT duplicate the code in html files, however, I'm not sure how to point each link to preference its .js file.
* the code of Assignment 2 could be shorter with the same results/functionalities
